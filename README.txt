This program is just an excuse for me to play with libavcodec. It successfully plays back at least certain videos (tested with H264 .avi and .mp4), sound excluded, in a WPF window.

To turn this into a proper WPF video player, the following features would be required:
 - Sound playback
 - Audio/video synchronization
 - Support for stop/pause/resume/seeking
 - GUI for all of those functionalities
